# Deploy BOSH on Google Cloud Platform

These instructions walk you through deploying a BOSH Director on Google Cloud Platform using manual networking and a network that allows private IP addresses with outbound Internet access provided by a NAT instance.

## Overview
Here are a few important facts about the architecture of the BOSH deployment you will create in this guide:

1. An isolated Google Compute Engine subnetwork will be created to contain the BOSH director and all deployments it creates.
1. The BOSH director will be created by a bastion instance (named `bosh-bastion`).
1. The bastion host will have a firewall rule allowing SSH access from the Internet.
1. Both the bastion host and BOSH director will have outbound Internet connectivity.
1. The BOSH director will allow inbound connectivity only from the bastion. All `bosh` commands must be executed from the bastion.
1. Both bastion and BOSH director will be deployed to an isolated subnetwork in the parent network.
1. The BOSH director will have a statically-assigned `10.0.0.6` IP address.

The following diagram provides an overview of the deployment:

## Configure your [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) environment

### Signup

1. [Sign up](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/signup) for Google Cloud Platform
1. Create a [new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)
1. Enable the [GCE API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute_component/overview) for your project
1. Enable the [IAM API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/iam.googleapis.com/overview) for your project
1. Enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/overview)

### Setup

1. In your new project, open Cloud Shell

1. Configure a few environment variables:

  ```
  export project_id=$(gcloud config list 2>/dev/null | grep project | sed -e 's/project = //g')
  export region=us-east1
  export zone=us-east1-d
  export service_account_email=terraform@${project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  ```

1. Configure `gcloud` to use your preferred region and zone:

  ```
  gcloud config set compute/zone ${zone}
  gcloud config set compute/region ${region}
  ```
  
1. Create a service account and key:

  ```
  gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform
  gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/terraform.key.json \
      --iam-account ${service_account_email}
  ```

1. Grant the new service account editor access to your project:

  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role roles/owner
  ```

1. Make your service account's key available in an environment variable to be used by `terraform`:

  ```
  export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=$(cat ~/terraform.key.json)
  ```

## Deploy supporting infrastructure
The following instructions offer the fastest path to getting BOSH up and running on Google Cloud Platform. Using [Terraform](terraform.io) you will provision all of the infrastructure required to run BOSH in just a few commands.

### Steps
> **Note:** All of these steps should be performed inside the Cloud Shell in your browser.

1. Clone this repository and go into the BOSH docs directory:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release.git
  cd bosh-google-cpi-release/docs/bosh
  ```

1. View the Terraform execution plan to see the resources that will be created:

  ```
  docker run -i -t \
    -e "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=${GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS}" \
    -v `pwd`:/$(basename `pwd`) \
    -w /$(basename `pwd`) \
    hashicorp/terraform:light plan \
      -var service_account_email=${service_account_email} \
      -var projectid=${project_id} \
      -var region=${region} \
      -var zone=${zone}
  ```

1. Create the resources:

  ```
  docker run -i -t \
    -e "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=${GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS}" \
    -v `pwd`:/$(basename `pwd`) \
    -w /$(basename `pwd`) \
    hashicorp/terraform:light apply \
      -var service_account_email=${service_account_email} \
      -var projectid=${project_id} \
      -var region=${region} \
      -var zone=${zone}
  ```

Now you have the infrastructure ready to deploy a BOSH director.

## Deploy BOSH

1. SSH to the bastion VM you created in the previous step. You can use Cloud Shell to SSH to the bastion, or you can connect from any workstation with `gcloud` installed. All SSH commands after this should be run from the bastion VM.

  ```
  gcloud compute ssh bosh-bastion
  ```

1. If you see a warning indicating the VM isn't ready, log out, wait a few moments, and log in again.

1. Once on the VM, update its Google Cloud SDK to the latest:

  ```
  sudo gcloud components update
  ```
  
  If it tells you to delete some executables, don't.

1. Create a service account. This service account will be used by BOSH and all VMs it creates:

  ```
  export service_account=bosh-user
  export project_id=$(gcloud config list 2>/dev/null | grep project | sed -e 's/project = //g')
  export service_account_email=${service_account}@${project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  gcloud iam service-accounts create ${service_account}
  ```

1. Grant the new service account editor access to your project:

  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role roles/compute.instanceAdmin
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role roles/compute.storageAdmin
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role roles/storage.admin
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role  roles/compute.networkAdmin
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
    --member serviceAccount:${service_account_email} \
    --role roles/iam.serviceAccountActor
  ```

1. Create a **password-less** SSH key and upload the public component:

  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/bosh -C bosh
  ```

  ```
  gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --metadata-from-file \
           sshKeys=<( gcloud compute project-info describe --format=json | jq -r '.commonInstanceMetadata.items[] | select(.key == "sshKeys") | .value' & echo "bosh:$(cat ~/.ssh/bosh.pub)" )
  ```

1. Confirm that `bosh-init` is installed by querying its version:

  ```
  bosh-init -v
  ```

1. Create and `cd` to a directory:

  ```
  mkdir google-bosh-director
  cd google-bosh-director
  ```

1. Use `vim` or `nano` to create a BOSH Director deployment manifest named `manifest.yml.erb`:

  ```

  <%
  ['zone', 'service_account_email', 'network', 'subnetwork', 'project_id', 'ssh_key_path'].each do |val|
    if ENV[val].nil? || ENV[val].empty?
      raise "Missing environment variable: #{val}"
    end
  end

1. Use `erb` to substitute variables in the template:

  ```
  erb manifest.yml.erb > manifest.yml
  ```

1. Deploy the new manifest to create a BOSH Director:

  ```
  bosh-init deploy manifest.yml
  ```

1. Target your BOSH environment:

  ```
  bosh target 10.0.0.6
  ```

Your username is `admin` and password is `admin`.

## Deploy other software

* [Deploying Cloud Foundry on Google Compute Engine](../cloudfoundry/README.md)

## Delete resources

Follow these instructions when you're ready to delete your BOSH deployment.

From your `bosh-bastion` instance, delete your BOSH director:

  ```
  cd ~/google-bosh-director
  bosh-init delete manifest.yml
  ```

From your Cloud Shell instance, run the following command to delete the infrastructure you created in this lab:

  ```
  # Set a few vars, in case they were forgotten
  export project_id=$(gcloud config list 2>/dev/null | grep project | sed -e 's/project = //g')
  export region=us-east1
  export zone=us-east1-d
  export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=$(cat ~/terraform.key.json)

  # Go to the place with the Terraform manifest
  cd bosh-google-cpi-release/docs/bosh/

  # Destroy the deployment
  docker run -i -t \
    -e "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=${GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS}" \
    -v `pwd`:/$(basename `pwd`) \
    -w /$(basename `pwd`) \
    hashicorp/terraform:light destroy \
      -var projectid=${project_id} \
      -var region=${region} \
      -var zone=${zone}
  ```
